			  Tiny Garden Blueprint

------------------------------------------------------

You are the temporary caretaker of a tiny garden, only until the owner returns from a far away sea-faring journey.
Everything is going as expected until you notice that the vegitation seem to have posessed a mind of their own. Almost as if they are sentient.
You begin to understand them more and more as the weeks go by. Befriending each and every seed.
Until you realize that you are becoming overwhelmed by their upkeep and that the only way to maintain this tiny haven is to embrace what has become a jungle of your creation.

Having mastered the art of gardening and now posessing some fairly green-stained fingers, you recieve news from the owner that he will be gone longer than expected.
This isn't a problem since your passion for gardening has grown to become more than just a paycheck.
On the last day of your stay, you recieve a postcard from the owner-

	Greetings from Tanzania!
		I am writing to inform you of my whereabouts.
	My expedition has extended longer than I originally planned
	and I apologize for any inconvinience that this has created for you.
	I do hope that my garden is thriving under your surveilence and upkeep!
	If perhaps the surroundings are becoming too bland day-to-day,
	I give you every permission to modify the looks my garden to your liking.
	Hopefully I will be able to return home once the weather has cleared up.
	I do wish to return home soon, but every captain I talk to won't stop
	going on and on about the dangers of the sea as of late.
		Best wishes and happy watering,
		Stanley
